  <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What do bed bugs look like?</h2>
  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
    Bed bugs are nasty and persistent insects that are often found in human dwellings. <b>Adult bed bugs</b> are red-brown, and do not have wings and are roughly the size of an apple seed. Their bodies become more elongated and bloated after they have the blood meal. <b>Nymphs</b> are the younger bed bugs that are way lighter. They are almost transparent in color, except when they have fed, and thus are hard to see. The eggs of bed bugs are minute (about 1mm), and pearly white.

  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
    Most of the time, bed bugs can be found within 8 feet from where people sleep. They tend to live in such places as mattress seams, box springs, bed frames, closets, drawers, where furniture parts join, under wallpaper, and in other places that are hard to access.

  <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Feeding Habits</h2>
  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
    Bed bugs are most active between 12:00 to 5:00 am and very particularly in the midnight period when you are in your deepest sleep. Bed bugs are fearless in the choice of their only food - blood. They are fond of human blood and make them their favourite hosts for feeding. They feed for less than 15 minutes and during this time they use their mouthparts to inject saliva into the skin containing an anesthetic and an anticoagulant to avoid humans noticing and stop the feeding.
