      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary text-center mb-4">Moths</h1>

<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
  Moths are nocturnal insects similar to butterflies. Attracted to light due to the scales on their wings, they’re commonly seen flying around homes, garden areas, and the edges of forests—often blending in thanks to their plain-colored wings.
</p>

<h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What Moths Look Like and Where You Can Find Them</h2>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
  Moths in the U.S. are known for their soft bodies, scaly wings, and dull colors. They vary widely in size—from the tiny clothes moth (6–7 mm) to the large Cecropia moth with a 7-inch wingspan. As nighttime fliers, moths are often spotted near doorways, lights, gardens, forests, or even inside homes. As the temperature cools, moths search for warm hiding spots, making urban and suburban homes attractive places to settle.
</p>

<h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Where Do Moths Come From?</h2>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
  Moth behavior depends on the species and life stage. While caterpillars of many species feed on leaves, others—like clothes moth larvae—feed on materials such as wool, silk, feathers, or stored food products like grains. Adult moths usually don’t eat and live only to reproduce. Females lay hundreds of eggs on food sources for larvae. Because moth eggs are small and hidden, infestations can go undetected. Moths often enter homes through open doors, windows, or infested items, making them hard to control indoors.
</p>

<h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Why Moth Infestations Are Increasing in the U.S.</h2>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
  Moth infestations in the U.S. are rising due to the abundance of natural-fiber clothing, stored grains, urban population density, and the ease of moth transfer between living spaces. Their larvae can damage clothing, food, and even building materials, creating costly problems for homeowners. Many people are unaware of how to prevent or remove pantry and clothes moths, which allows infestations to persist and grow.
