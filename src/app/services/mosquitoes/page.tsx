<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
  Mosquitoes are small insects that can fly. They bite to suck animal blood, and their bites can be itchy and sometimes spread serious diseases like dengue or malaria. It is important to take precautions to keep them away.
</p>

<h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Physical Appearance</h2>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
  Mosquitoes have a distinct body shape with a large lower abdomen, narrow upper body, and one pair of wings. Female mosquitoes have a specialized mouthpart that allows them to pierce skin and feed on the blood of humans and animals.
</p>

<h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Habitat</h2>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
  Mosquitoes prefer warm, damp areas and often breed in standing water such as birdbaths, clogged drains, gutters, ponds, and even water-filled containers. These environments provide the ideal conditions for laying eggs and growing larvae.
</p>

<h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Feeding Behavior</h2>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
  Both male and female mosquitoes feed on plant nectar, but only females bite to extract blood. This blood provides essential proteins needed for egg development. Mosquitoes are generally active during the early morning and evening, though some species may also bite during the day.
</p>

<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
  Mosquitoes are drawn to carbon dioxide, body heat, and sweat, which is why they often target humans. Increasing mosquito populations and mosquito-borne diseases are a growing concern globally and in the U.S., mainly due to:

  <li>Abundant breeding sites</li>
  <li>Climatic changes</li>
  <li>Unclean surroundings</li>
</ul>

<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
  These factors contribute to the spread of diseases like West Nile virus, Zika, dengue, and chikungunya.
