          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Of all the numerous species of pests, it is the flies that are the most common in the United States. Flies are small to the middle in size; they are normally 1/8 to 1/4 inches long with Gray or black bodies which are occasionally striped.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Habitat and Population Growth</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            As their habitats are very adaptable, flies can remain and multiply anywhere, from urban to rural areas, and are especially attracted to hotspots where organic matter is in plenty. Flies, by using their specialized mouthparts to either dip the liquid or to dissolve the solid food by the regurgitation of their digestive fluids, can consume a variety of foodstuff such as rotting food, garbage, animal waste, and even sugary liquids. Fly populations in the United States has increased due to the weather (heat and humidity), an increase in food waste, and there is a growth in the number of places where flies may lay their eggs â€“ both in homes and in the localities of the business.

            is of primary concern to the American population due to the presence of an ideal climate for such flies, and the availability of many spots where the reproduction process of these pests can take place. Getting rid of flies in your home is essential as they are not just a botheration but have been found to be carriers of disease. They can pass several diseases to people by contaminating food and surfaces with germs of their sources of origin.
